# Full Page Content

## Get Started with GitLens

URL: https://help.gitkraken.com/gitlens/gitlens-home/

Welcome to the GitLens Support Documentation site!

GitLens is the #1 most downloaded Visual Studio Code Git extension that supercharges your developer workflows. GitLens is known for its blame, hover, and annotations, but there's much more to the extension. Users are leveraging its rich features to increase their developer productivity through Interactive Code History, Accelerate PR Reviews, and Streamline Collaboration.

### Interactive Code History

Understanding your repository's history is easier with GitLens. Whether you're navigating complex branches or reviewing past changes, GitLens offers intuitive tools to reveal who changed what and why.

**Commit Graph** – The Commit Graph provides an interactive visual history of your branches and commits. It helps you follow the development of features and bug fixes over time, quickly search and jump to specific commits or branches, and understand commit context through messages and structure. Open it via Command Palette > "GitLens: Show Commit Graph View".

**GitLens Inspect** – Helps you dive deeper into a specific commit. It shows modified files and changed lines, related Jira issues or pull requests via autolinks, and file or line history for better context. Right-click any commit and select "Inspect Details".

**Inline Blame and Hovers** – Reveals who last modified each line and why. Hover over any line to view commit details, navigate to the previous revision, open the associated pull request, or see the commit in the Commit Graph.

### Accelerate PR Reviews

GitLens helps you stay focused in Visual Studio Code by organizing pull request tasks and supporting multiple workspaces with worktrees.

**Launchpad (PRO)** – Provides a centralized view of your pull requests. View PRs by action status: needs review, follow-up, blocked, draft, and more. Open pull requests in a new worktree or switch branches directly. Access via Command Palette > "GitLens: Open Launchpad".

**Worktrees** – Let you check out multiple branches at once without stashing or committing changes in progress. Review pull requests without leaving your current work, keep separate working directories for isolated tasks.

### Streamline Team Collaboration

GitLens enables flexible collaboration without needing to commit or push unfinished code.

**Cloud Patches (PRO)** – Sharable Git patches that can be applied across your GitKraken organization. Share changes without committing to remote.

**Code Suggest (PRO)** – Suggest code edits to any file, even those not changed in the original PR. The pull request owner can apply, modify, and commit these suggestions.

### Connect GitLens to External Services

Boost productivity by integrating GitLens with GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket, Jira, and Trello.

**Integrations** – Connect to your code host and issue tracker to sync repositories, automatically show pull requests related to your branch, and avoid switching between your editor and browser.

**Autolinks** – Automatically link external issues like Jira tickets or Trello cards directly in commit messages, file annotations, and code lenses.

## Orchestrating Complex Git Operations

URL: https://help.gitkraken.com/gitlens/GL-Workflow-Orchestrate-Complex-Git-Operations/

**Level:** Advanced Developers
**Primary Goal:** Apply Git intelligence and AI-aware context to manage complex history safely

### When to use this workflow
- Managing long-lived or high-risk branches
- Performing complex interactive rebases
- Pulling targeted fixes across branches
- Coordinating advanced workflows with AI assistance

### How GitLens helps

**GitKraken MCP** provides Git-aware context to AI assistants so they can reason accurately about your repository, including commits, branches, pull requests, and issues.

From the **Commit Graph**, launch the enhanced **Rebase Editor** which uses Git intelligence to detect potential conflicts before the rebase begins. Perform bulk operations such as squashing, reordering, or editing commits using full keyboard navigation. Switch to the raw rebase todo file when you need fine-grained control.

**Cherry-pick** specific commits from the Commit Graph by right-clicking the exact commit—avoiding manual hash copying or terminal commands.

**Cloud Patches** package your changes so teammates can review or apply them without branch friction.

### Key GitLens features used
- GitKraken MCP (Git-aware AI context)
- Commit Graph (advanced history visualization)
- Rebase Editor (conflict-aware interactive rebasing)
- Cherry-picking (precise commit reuse)
- Cloud Patches (lightweight collaboration)

### Outcome
You safely execute complex Git operations with full visibility, precision, and collaboration support, even in high-stakes scenarios.
