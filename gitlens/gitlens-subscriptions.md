Subscriptions are tied directly to an [organization](/gitlens/gitlens-organization/), even if the subscription is for one user. The subscription is identical for everyone in the organization and one license is required for every member (unless their [role](/gitlens/gitlens-organization/#roles) does not use a license).

## How to Purchase
To purchase a subscription for the first time follow these steps:
1. Visit [app.gitkraken.com](https://app.gitkraken.com/).
2. Login with your [GitKraken account](/gitlens/gitlens-account/) or create an account.
3. Select your organization in the left panel and select "Purcahse License" (remember you need to have a [role](/gitkraken-client/gitkraken-organization/#roles) with permission to purchase). If you intend to purchase on another organization, select “Create organization.”
4. Select the tier that is best for your organization (Pro, Teams, or Enterprise). There are links at the bottom of each while can further elaborate on the differences.
5. You will then be taken to the billing form where you can select the quantity of licenses (one for each member of the organization that will be using the product).
6. Fill out the rest of the form with all the relevant billing information and name your organization.
7. Select the "<span style='color: green;'>Complete Purchase</span>" button to complete your transaction.
8. If you added more licenses than there are members in the organization to claim, you will be taken to the "Add Users" screen.

## Cancel

You can cancel your subscription at any time. To do so, login to [app.gitkraken.com](https://app.gitkraken.com/), select the organization, select "Subscription" on the left side, and select "<span style='color: yellow;'>Cancel Subscription</span>." Follow the flow to complete cancelation. Once canceled, you will keep your subscription for the remainder of its billing period. Once the period is up, everyone in the organization will lose access to the subscription.

When your subscription is set to cancel but you can still use it, your organization will be labeled as "<span style='color: red;'>non-renewing</span>." When your subscription is completely canceled and the billing period has passed, it will be lableld as "<span style='color: red;'>canceled</span>."

## Reactivation

You can always reactivate a canceled subscription. You can reactivate by logging into [app.gitkraken.com](https://app.gitkraken.com/), select the organization, select "Subscription" on the left side, and select "<span style='color: green;'>reactivate</span>." Please note the two cases.

If your subscription is set to cancel but still active, denoted as <span style='color: red;'>non-renewing</span>, reactivation will not charge you until your next renewal or if you decide to upgrade from the plan you already have.

Before reactivating, you can switch your subscription by selecting "<span style='color: green;'>Switch</span>", selecting the desired plan, and then selecting "<span style='color: green;'>Reactivate</span>".
