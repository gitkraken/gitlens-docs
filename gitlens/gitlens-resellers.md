## New Organization Purchases

Follow this reseller guide for purchasing and user license management information.

***

### 1. Create an account or sign in

First, create a GitKraken account using your reseller email address by navigating to [app.gitkraken.com](https://app.gitkraken.com/register).

+ Be sure to create an account using email, do not use the auto-sign-in options (like "sign in with GitHub").
+ Do not enter end-user information on the account creation form. Resellers should register with their own email.
+ After account creation you will need to verify your email before taking any action. This is done by selecting the link sent to your email.

   	<p>If you make GitKraken purchases for multiple customers and already have a GitKraken account, choose to sign into an existing account and continue onto Step 2.</p>

Once you have created your GitKraken account, your account is tied to the primary email address of whichever method you selected. If you use the “Sign up with Email” method, you will need to verify your email address with a link sent to your email.

### 2. Create a New Organization

### 3. Purchase


<div class='callout callout--basic'>
   	<p>GitKraken Subscriptions only accept card, PayPal, and ACH bank payments. However, invoicing is supported for large purchases of GitKraken Enterprise. Contact our <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/gitlens/contact-sales">Customer Success team</a> to learn more.</p>
</div>

To complete the purchase, input:
**Quantity:** Number of licenses for the customer
**Organization name:** Organization of the customer
**This purchase is for someone else:** Check this option and fillout the contact email of the customer
**Payment information:** Enter reseller billing details

Once the purchase is complete you will be emailed a copy of your receipt. The customer will receive an email to accept as owner of the organization. They have 7 days to accept this and you will remain as owner until they accept it. If the 7 days lapse you can always reinitiate [transfer ownership](/gitlens/gitlens-organization/#transfer-ownership).

You can [add users](/gitlens/gitlens-organization/#add-users) to the organization if the customer asks you to, otherwise the new owner and whoever they make an admin can as well.
