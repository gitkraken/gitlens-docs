## What Is Code Suggest?

**GitLens Code Suggest** simplifies code review by allowing you to make suggestions and edits across the entire project, not just on changed lines.  
Suggestions can be created within **GitLens**, **GitKraken Desktop**, or **gitkraken.dev** and attached to pull requests.  

Reviewers can then view, accept, and apply these suggestions directly to the pull request branch.

## Start a Code Suggestion

1. Open the [GitLens Inspect Overview](/gitlens/side-bar/#overview) for your repository.  
2. Check out a branch with an open pull request.  
3. Select **Start Review for PR #PR**.  
4. Modify and save any files you want to include in the suggestion.  
5. When ready, select **Suggest Changes for PR** → provide a title → **Create Code Suggestion**.

This action adds a comment on the pull request with two options:  
- **Code Suggestion for #PR** → review in **gitkraken.dev**  
- **Locally on your machine** → review in **GitLens** or **GitKraken Desktop**

## Review and Apply Suggestions Locally

2. Open the suggestion in GitLens or [GitKraken Desktop](/gitkraken-client/pull-requests/#review-code-and-suggest-changes).  
3. Review changes file by file.  
4. Choose **Apply** to apply to your current branch, or select **Apply to a Branch** to apply to a new or existing branch.
