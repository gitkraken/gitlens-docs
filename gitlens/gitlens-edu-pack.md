GitKraken Pro is available for free to students through the GitHub Student Pack. If you don't have the pack yet, first apply through GitHub:

[Get the GitHub Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)

<div class='callout callout--warning'>
    <p>🚨<strong>Important:</strong> Once you get the pack, you must sign into your GitKraken account through GitHub one more time to enable Pro on your account.

## Enabling Pro for Students

Once GitHub has approved your pack, you must sign into your GitKraken account through GitHub <strong>1 more time</strong> to enable Pro.

To sign in again, launch Visual Studio code, open the command pallet (`command/ctrl + shift + P`), and type `GitLens: Sign In to Gitkraken...`.

From the sign in page, select `Sign in with GitHub`.

When you sign in with GitHub, GitLens will check whether your GitHub account has the GitHub Student Pack. If the app sees the pack, you should see the `Pro` flag in GitLens.

If you don't see `Pro` then this means GitLens does not see a pack with the email address tied to your GitHub account. This may mean you need to update the primary email address for your GitHub.com account.
