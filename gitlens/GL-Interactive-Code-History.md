Understanding code history in large repositories can be challenging, especially with multiple branches and contributors. GitLens helps simplify this process by providing tools that surface meaningful context:

- **Commit Graph** – Visualize the structure of your repository.
- **GitLens Inspect** – Drill into file and line-level history.
- **Inline Blame and Hovers** – Quickly see who changed what and when.

These features make it easier to navigate your repository, understand changes, and make informed decisions about your code.
