Understanding code history can be difficult when looking at complex repositories with multiple branches and contributors. Developers can struggle to easily see who made changes, why, and when. With the use of The Commit Graph, GitLens Inspect, and Inline Blame and Hovers, GitLens offers the ability to easily navigate through your repository to provide insights about the history and interact with it to better manage your code.
