Welcome to the GitLens Support Documentation site! 

GitLens is an extension built to work with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). If you don't already have GitLens installed, you can do so from the Visual Studio Code marketplace:

GitLens simply helps you better understand code. Quickly glimpse into whom, why, and when a line or code block was changed. Jump back through history to gain further insights as to how and why the code evolved. Effortlessly explore the history and evolution of a codebase. Dive right in and see how GitLens can help!
