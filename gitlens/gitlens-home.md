GitLens is known for its blame, hover, and annotations, but there‚Äôs much more to the extension. Users are leveraging its rich features to increase their developer productivity, which you can learn more about in the popular workflows below. 

* [Interactive Code History](/gitlens/gitlens-home/#interactive-code-history)
* [Accelerate PR Reviews](/gitlens/gitlens-home/#accelerate-pr-reviews)
* [Streamline Collaboration](/gitlens/gitlens-home/#streamline-collaboration)

## Interactive Code History

Understanding your repository's history is easier with GitLens. Whether you're navigating complex branches or reviewing past changes, GitLens offers intuitive tools to reveal who changed what and why.

### View the Commit Graph

The Commit Graph provides an interactive visual history of your branches and commits. It helps you:

- Follow the development of features and bug fixes over time
- Quickly search and jump to specific commits or branches
- Understand commit context through messages and structure

**To open the Commit Graph:**

- Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) and run **GitLens: Show Commit Graph View**, or
- Click the **Commit Graph** icon in the sidebar

[Open the Commit Graph in GitLens](vscode://eamodio.gitlens/link/command/graph)

### Use GitLens Inspect

GitLens Inspect helps you dive deeper into a specific commit. It shows:

- Modified files and changed lines
- Related Jira issues or pull requests via autolinks
- File or line history for better context

**To open Inspect View:**

- Right-click any commit and select **Inspect Details**

[Open the Inspect View in GitLens](vscode://eamodio.gitlens/link/command/inspect)

### Explore Inline Blame and Hovers

Inline Blame reveals who last modified each line and why. Hover over any line to:

- View commit details
- Navigate to the previous revision
- Open the associated pull request
- See the commit in the Commit Graph

These insights help you trace decisions and collaborate more effectively.

## Accelerate PR Reviews

</figure>

Manually switching between browser tabs, emails, and PR tools can interrupt your development flow. GitLens helps you stay focused in Visual Studio Code by organizing pull request tasks and supporting multiple workspaces with worktrees.

### Launchpad `PRO`
<div class='callout callout--warning'>
    <p>This feature is only available for Pro subscription tiers or higher.</p>
</div>

Launchpad provides a centralized view of your pull requests. You can:

- Connect your [GitHub Integration](https://gitkraken.dev/settings/integrations?source=help_center&product=gitlens)
- View PRs by action status: needs review, follow-up, blocked, draft, and more
- Open pull requests in a new worktree or switch branches directly

**To access Launchpad:**

- Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) and run **GitLens: Open Launchpad**

[Open the Launchpad in GitLens](vscode://eamodio.gitlens/link/command/launchpad)


### Worktrees

### Worktrees
<div class='callout callout--warning'>
    <p>The Community plan supports only public and local repositories.</p>
</div>

Worktrees let you check out multiple branches at once without stashing or committing changes in progress. This allows you to:

- Review pull requests without leaving your current work
- Keep separate working directories for isolated tasks
- Open a worktree and inspect file diffs, commit history, and changed files directly from the Pull Request sidebar

**To open Worktree View:**

[Open the Worktree View in GitLens](vscode://eamodio.gitlens/link/command/worktrees)

## Streamline Team Collaboration

</div>
<figcaption style="text-align:center; color:#888">Video: Share code and suggest changes in GitLens</figcaption>
</figure>

GitLens enables flexible collaboration without needing to commit or push unfinished code. Use **Cloud Patches** to share changes privately and **Code Suggest** to offer improvements across a pull request‚Äîeven for unmodified files.

### Cloud Patches `PRO`
<div class='callout callout--warning'>
    <p>This feature is only available for Pro subscription tiers or higher.</p>
</div>

Cloud Patches are sharable Git patches that can be applied across your GitKraken organization:

- Make and save changes to any file
- Open the Command Palette and run **GitLens: Share as Cloud Patch‚Ä¶**
- Select collaborators to notify via the Cloud Patch sidebar

[Open the Cloud Patches View in GitLens](vscode://eamodio.gitlens/link/command/cloud-patches)

### Code Suggest `PRO`
<div class='callout callout--warning'>
    <p>This feature is only available for Pro subscription tiers or higher.</p>
</div>

Suggest code edits to any file‚Äîeven those not changed in the original PR:

- Check out a branch with an open pull request
- Make and save your proposed changes
- Open the Command Palette and run **GitLens: Show Inspect View**, then choose **Suggest Changes for PR**

The pull request owner can apply, modify, and commit these suggestions to streamline reviews and collaboration.

## Connect GitLens to External Services

</div>
<figcaption style="text-align:center; color:#888">Video: Use integrations and autolinks to connect GitLens to tools like Jira</figcaption>
</figure>

Boost your productivity by integrating GitLens with platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket, Jira, and Trello. Reduce context switching and bring external issue tracking directly into your Git workflows.

### Integrations

Connect GitLens to your code host and issue tracker to:

- Sync and manage repositories inside Launchpad
- Automatically show pull requests and issues related to your branch
- Avoid switching between your editor and browser

To set up an integration, go to **Settings > Integrations** or visit the [GitLens Integrations Settings](https://gitkraken.dev/settings/integrations?source=help_center&product=gitlens).

### Autolinks

Autolinks let you automatically link external issues‚Äîlike Jira tickets or Trello cards‚Äîdirectly in commit messages, file annotations, and code lenses.

You can also create custom autolinks by defining pattern-matching rules for external references like Zendesk or Linear. This helps keep your codebase traceable and well-documented.
