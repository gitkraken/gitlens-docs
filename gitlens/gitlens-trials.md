## Trials 

Both GitLens and [GitKraken Client](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitkraken-client/gitkraken-client-home/) offer 7-day trials of Pro. You can initiate these trials by logging into the corresponding app with a GitKraken account for the first time. Each trial is separate, so starting a 7-day trial with your GitKraken account in one app does not start it for the other.

### Multi-User Trials 

Multi-user trials are available for groups of users that would like to try the [GitKraken Suite](www.gitkraken.com/suite) across members of their team, company, or organization. After a multi-user trial is started, it will be active for 30 days. The duration of the multi-user trial is shared by everyone in the organization. 
 
To start a multi-user trial: 
 
1. Visit [app.gitkraken.com](https://app.gitkraken.com/) 
2. Login with your GitKraken account 
3. Select your organization and then â€œStart Multi-User Trial"
5. [Add users](/gitlens/gitlens-organization/#add-users) 
6. Once users are added, your extended Multi-user trial has begun
