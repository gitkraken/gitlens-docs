## Trials 

Both GitKraken Client and GitLens offer 7-day trials of Pro. You can initiate these trials by logging into the corresponding app with a GitKraken account for the first time. Each trial is separate, so starting a 7-day trial with your GitKraken account in one app does not start it for the other.

### Organization Trials 

Organization trials are available for groups of users that would like to try the [GitKraken Suite](www.gitkraken.com/suite) across members of their team, company, or organization. After an organization trial is started, a 30-day trial will be started. The duration of the organization trial is shared by everyone in the organization. 
 
To start an organization trial: 
 
1. Visit [app.gitkraken.com](https://app.gitkraken.com/) 
2. Login with your GitKraken account 
3. Select “New trial organization” (if you already have an organization and have not started a trial organization, select that and continue with step 5) 
4. Name the organization when prompted 
5. [Add users](/gitlens/gitlens-organization/#add-users) 
6. Once users are added, your extended organization trial has begun
