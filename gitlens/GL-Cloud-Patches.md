## What Are Cloud Patches?

A **Cloud Patch** is a Git patch securely stored by GitKraken so it can be easily shared across **GitLens**, **GitKraken Desktop**, and the **GitKraken CLI**.  
The patch is transferred directly from your machine into secure storage.

Cloud Patches let you collaborate with your team **before creating a pull request**. You can share work in progress, gather feedback early, and minimize delays in pull request reviews.

## Set Up Cloud Patches

To enable or disable Cloud Patches per client:

1. Open the Command Palette:  
   - macOS: <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>  
   - Windows/Linux: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>  
2. Search for **Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)**.  
3. Set the value of `gitlens.cloudPatches.enabled`:  
   - `true` = enabled (default)  
   - `false` = disabled

## Create and Share Cloud Patches

You can manage Cloud Patches from the **Cloud Patches view** in the GitLens sidebar.

A Cloud Patch can be created from **Working Changes, Commits, Stashes, or Comparisons** by selecting **Share as Cloud Patch** from either:  
- The Command Palette  
- The **Share** submenu in applicable GitLens views

### Sharing Options
When creating a Cloud Patch, choose one of the following:

- **Anyone with the link**: Public access for anyone with the link.  
- **Anyone in my org**: Accessible to members of your GitKraken Organization (authentication required).  
- **Only collaborators**: Restricted to selected GitKraken Organization members (authentication required). Use **Invite** to select members.  

Cloud Patches shared with you appear under **Shared with Me** in the Cloud Patches section.

## Self-Host Cloud Patch Data

If you do not want Cloud Patch data stored on GitKraken servers, you can host Cloud Patches on your own **AWS S3 storage instance**.  

For configuration instructions, see [Self-Hosted Documentation](/gk-dev/gk-dev-home/#self-hosted).

  <p>Note: If you belong to multiple organizations, you can switch between them from the GitKraken Account view.</p>
