## Version 17.3

#### Tuesday, July 8, 2025

GitLens 17.3 transforms how you search and interact with your repository history. This release introduces natural language search for both the Commit Graph and Commit Search commands, enhanced time-based filtering, improved AI-powered commit generation and the ability to provide feedback on AI results.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-17-3-hero.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### Natural Language Search for Commits `PRO`
Say goodbye to complex query syntax! GitLens 17.3 introduces natural language search for the Commit Graph and command palette, allowing you to find exactly what you're looking for using natural language.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/natural-language-search-17-3.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

Instead of memorizing query tags like `@me`, `message:`, `author:`, or `file:`, simply describe what you're looking for:

"Show all commits made by Eric this week"

"Find commits that modified package.json last week"

"Show all commits that changed files with "auth" in the name in the last 12 days"

GitLens leverages AI to automatically translate your natural language queries into the appropriate search syntax, making repository exploration more intuitive than ever. You can still reveal the generated query to learn the underlying syntax and refine your searches.

### Time-Based Search Filters
GitLens 17.3 adds powerful new `after:` and `before:` filters that make temporal filtering more intuitive and flexible.
These new filters work seamlessly with both traditional query syntax and the new natural language search:

- `after:2025-01-01` - commits made after January 1st, 2025
- `before:2024-12-25` - commits made before December 25th, 2024
- `after:6.months.ago` - commits made after 6 months ago
- `before:2.weeks.ago` - commits made before 2 weeks ago

The filters accept specific date strings (YYYY-MM-DD format) or relative date expressions, and integrate automatically when using natural language queries, making it easier than ever to focus on specific timeframes in your repository history.

### Enhanced Commit Composer Access `PREVIEW`
Building on the Commit Composer preview introduced in 17.2, we've made AI-powered commit generation more accessible by adding it directly to the Commit Details panel with an option to `Commit with AI (Preview)`.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/generate-commits-ai-commit-details-17-3.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

You can now generate multiple commits at once from your working directory changes with a single click, streamlining the process of creating meaningful, well-structured commits with AI assistance.

üìù _While in Preview, Commit Composer will create a stash of your changes as a backup when generating commits should you need to revert them. You can also undo the generated commits with a single click from the success notification._

### AI Feature Feedback
GitLens can now collect feedback about AI-powered features. When using AI capabilities like explaining commits, branches, and stashes, or generating commits with Commit Composer, you'll notice new üëç and üëé icons in the toolbar of generated summaries that will tell us if the result was helpful or not.

This feedback helps us understand how well our AI results meet your needs and allows us to refine our prompts and models to deliver better, more relevant outputs. Your input is invaluable as we continue to enhance the accuracy and usefulness of GitLens AI features.

---

### Added

- Adds support for using natural language to search for commits on the _Commit Graph_, _Search & Compare_ view, and in the _Search Commits_ command using AI ([#4471](https://github.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/issues/4471))
- Adds support for time-based commit searches on the _Commit Graph_, _Search & Compare_ view, and in the _Search Commits_ command
- Adds üëç "Helpful" and üëé "Unhelpful" feedback buttons to AI-generated markdown previews such as Commit Composer and Explain Changes ([#4449](https://github.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/issues/4449))
- Adds a _Commit with AI (Preview)_ button to the _Inspect Overview_ tab of the _Commit Graph_ and _Inspect_ views

### Changed

- Improves experience for invalid AI rebase responses by implementing conversational retry logic that provides specific feedback to the AI about missing, extra, or duplicate hunks and automatically retries up to 3 times ([#4395](https://github.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/issues/4395))

### Fixed

- Fixes stashes with parent commits older than the oldest stash not being visible on branches ([#4401](https://github.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/issues/4401))

## Version 17.2

#### Tuesday, June 17, 2025

GitLens 17.2 transforms how you craft your Git history with the early preview of Commit Composer, a set of AI-powered features that automatically organize your changes into meaningful, well-structured commits. This release also refines the Home View UX to streamline workflows, introduces advanced AI security controls for organizations, and delivers a cleaner AI explanation experience‚Äîall designed to help you tell better stories with your code.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-17-2-hero.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### Commit Composer Early `Preview`
In this release, we're excited to share an early preview of **Commit Composer**, a set of AI-powered features that help you organize your Git commits into clear, logical stories.

Commit Composer will analyze your code changes and use AI to:
- **Organize related changes** across files into logical, cohesive commits
- **Generate meaningful commit messages** that clearly describe what each commit accomplishes
- **Create commit descriptions** that provide helpful context for reviewers

There are two main operations available in this early preview:
1.  **Generate commits from working directory changes**
2.  **Generate new commits from existing changes on a branch**

Read more about how to use these preview features and join the [Commit Composer Discussion](https://github.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/discussions/4408).

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/commit-composer-17-2.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### Work Item UX Improvements in Home View
We're refining the GitLens Home view based on user feedback. In this release, we're focused on improving clarity around the three key components of the current work item: the active branch, the linked issue, and the related pull request.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/home-view-improvements-17-2.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

#### Streamlined Issue Association
When no issue is associated with your current branch, we've removed the large "Associate an Issue" button to reduce visual clutter. You can still associate issues using the subtle issue icon in the header.
When an issue is identified, it now appears above the current branch to reinforce the natural workflow progression from issue ‚Üí branch ‚Üí pull request.

#### Enhanced Repository Navigation
The main header is now a breadcrumb that helps you understand your current repo context. The repository name is collapsed by default with the branch prominently displayed, so you always know which branch you're working on. Hover over the breadcrumb to reveal the full repository name when needed.

#### Simplified Pull Request Creation
We've consolidated the "Create Pull Request" and "Create with AI" buttons into a streamlined split button. Click the main button for standard PR creation, or click the smaller ‚ú® button to generate AI-powered titles and descriptions.

### Advanced AI Security Controls for Organizations `ADVANCED`
Organizations on the Advanced plan now have granular control over AI provider access for their teams. Admins can:

- Disable specific AI providers to block access to certain models
- Set custom API keys for specific providers that all organization members will use
- Configure custom URLs and keys for additional AI providers

These controls ensure compliance with organizational security policies while maintaining access to AI-powered features.

### Refined AI Explanations
AI explanations now open in a single rendered markdown file instead of showing both the rendered content and markdown source. This reduces editor tab clutter and provides a cleaner reading experience that can be easily closed without save prompts.

---

### Added

- Adds new AI commands (in preview) which can generate (and rebase) commits from working tree changes or from commits in an existing branch ([#4301](https://github.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/issues/4301)):

## Version 16.2

#### Friday, January 17, 2025

GitLens 16.2 brings support for self-hosted GitHub Enterprise and GitLab Self-Managed integrations, introduces expanded merge target status tracking, and improves search and navigation features in Launchpad and the Home View. New and improved visualizations for file & folder history and improved merge request search make it easier to track changes and manage Git workflows.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-16-2-hero.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### Self-Hosted GitHub and GitLab Integration Support

GitLens Pro now supports integration with self-hosted GitHub Enterprise and GitLab Self-Managed instances, allowing users to access issue, pull request, and merge request context directly within GitLens.

- Issues and pull/merge requests from GitHub Enterprise and GitLab Self-Managed will now appear in the GitLens [Home View](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitlens/home-view/) when linked to branches.
- The [Start Work](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitlens/home-view/#starting-work-on-an-issue) flow now allows users to create branches and worktrees from issues in GitHub Enterprise and GitLab Self-Managed.
- [Launchpad](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitlens/gitlens-features/#launchpad-pro) now supports searching for specific pull/merge requests in GitHub Enterprise and GitLab Self-Managed integrations.

### Home View Enhancements

#### Git Action States

Home View now shows when Git actions (such as merge, rebase, cherry-pick, and revert) are paused due to conflicts, or when you're in the middle of a rebase or merge. The indicator lets you continue or skip steps, open the GitLens rebase editor, or abort the operation.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/paused-rebase-states.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

#### Merge Target Status

In GitLens 16.1, we introduced merge targets in the Home View to display the status of the current branch relative to its merge target and proactively highlights potential conflicts. In 16.2, we've expanded this feature to include status indicators for branches that have already been merged‚Äîeither locally or into the upstream branch.

This can help identify branches that have been merged but not yet pushed, or branches that have been merged into the upstream branch but not yet deleted.

#### Improved GitLens View Navigation

Home View can now be accessed directly from the Commit Graph, improving context switching between GitLens views.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/home-view-from-graph.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### Merge Request Search for GitLab

GitLab and GitLab Self-Managed users can now search for specific merge requests in Launchpad by title, PR number, or URL‚Äîeven for merge requests they aren't assigned to.

### Improved Visual File History

The [Visual File History](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitlens/gitlens-features/#visual-file-history-pro) has been completely rebuilt for a better more polished experience, with more consistent bubble sizing and easier to read hovers. We've also added new zoom in and out buttons and mouse wheel support. When you are zoomed in, drag to scrub (scroll) through the history.

### New Visual Folder History

[Visual File History](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitlens/gitlens-features/#visual-file-history-pro) now supports interactive visualizations of an entire folder's change history, allowing you to track how a group of files has evolved over time. From the visualization, you can identify changes made by specific authors and jump directly to commits to inspect changes in detail. Access the Visual Folder History from the _Folder History_ > _Open Visual Folder History_ on folders in the _Explorer_, _Source Control_, and in GitLens views.

## Version 16.1

#### Thursday, December 18, 2024

GitLens 16.1 introduces further refinements to the Home View launched in version 16.0, with improved integration and account management, expanded issue association capabilities, and streamlined branch creation. Performance optimizations, proactive conflict detection, and enhanced PR search functionality aim to boost productivity and deliver a more intuitive developer workflow experience.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-16-1-hero.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### Home View

#### UI/UX Improvements

Branch cards have been redesigned to more clearly display important status information and clearly list associated work items like issues and pull requests. Branch owners are now prominently displayed so you can quickly identify who the primary contributor of a branch is.

#### Integrations & Account Bar

The new integrations and account bar at the top of the Home View provides clear indicators for connecting to and monitoring integration statuses for GitHub, GitLab, and Jira. It also defines account types and states with convenient actions for managing accounts.

### Issue Association

GitLens now offers enhanced support for Issues, allowing you to associate them with branches and pull requests directly from the Home View. This feature streamlines the process of completing units of work and now includes the ability to link issues to existing branches.

### Start Work

The Start Work Flow has been redesigned to simplify and streamline the process of beginning new tasks. Separate flows are now available for starting work from an issue and for creating a new branch. Additionally, the number of steps required to start work on an issue has been reduced, enabling faster transitions from planning to execution.

### Launchpad

Launchpad now offers expanded functionality, allowing you to search for pull requests beyond those directly associated with you or currently in the Launchpad. This expanded capability improves flexibility and access to relevant PRs for better workflow management.

GitLens now provides a visual indicator of the status of branches relative to their merge targets. This feature helps you quickly identify branches that are up-to-date, behind, or ahead of their merge targets, streamlining the process of managing and merging branches.

### Conflict Detection `PRO`

GitLens now includes proactive Conflict Detection to help you avoid merge issues. During rebase and merge operations, Pro users will receive warnings about potential conflicts. The Home View will also alert you when the current branch is likely to conflict during rebasing or merging, along with actions to initiate a rebase or merge to proactively resolve conflicts.

## Version 16.0

#### Thursday, November 14, 2024

GitLens 16 brings a reimagined Home View, streamlined Source Control grouping, improved branch workflows, enhanced graph filtering, new pull request search capabilities, and AI-powered features to boost your productivity.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-16-0-hero.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### New Home View

GitLens 16 introduces a completely reimagined Home View (accessible via the GitLens icon in the VS Code activity bar) to streamline your development workflow.

The new Home View helps guide your daily workflow by answering key questions: "What am I working on now?", "What do I need to do next?", and "What have I worked on recently?" These answers are provided in the three main sections of the Home View:

#### Repository

Shows your current repository and branch, alongside the repository state and actions for syncing (push, pull, fetch), switching repos/branches, and viewing working directory changes.

If your branch is tied to a pull request or issue, GitLens surfaces those details so you can check PR status, continue reviews, or revisit issue specs. GitLens will also guide you to start a PR from your current branch if it can't find one.

#### Launchpad

Unblocks you and your team by showing pull requests that need your review, are blocked, or are ready to merge. Quickly jump to PRs to review, comment, or merge.
With the new Start work action, you can easily begin a new branch or worktree, or generate one from an existing issue.

> üí° Connect integrations to view pull request and issue information in GitLens

#### Recent

Lets you quickly return to previous work by showing recent branches, worktrees, and PRs with activity for your chosen timeframe.

#### Feedback

We'll be continuing to refine this view in future releases and welcome your feedback to help shape it. Join in on the [New Home View Discussion](https://github.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/discussions/3721).

### Consolidated GitLens Source Control Views

GitLens Source Control Views (Commits, Branches, Remotes, etc.) can now be grouped under a unified "GitLens" view. You can navigate grouped views by clicking the icons in the new "GitLens" view, or detach them to be displayed as individual views in Source Control. This should reduce clutter in your workspace and give you more control over which views are prominently displayed.

### "Start Work" Workflow

The new Start Work feature allows you to quickly create a branch or worktree, either from scratch or from an existing GitHub or Jira issue. GitLens will even name your branch based on the issue title and number, making it easy to stay organized. Access it from the Home View or via the command palette `GitLens: Start work`.

### Graph Filtering

We‚Äôve added a toggle to filter the commit graph, allowing you to hide non-matching commits during a search. This makes it easy to focus only on relevant changes.

### Launchpad PR Search

## Version 15.6

#### Monday, October 7, 2024

GitLens 15.6 arrives with easier branch workflows from within the Commit Graph, Account View integrated into the Home View, improved Cursor support, and a host of other improvements and bug fixes.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-15-6-hero.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### Commit Graph Improvements

GitLens 15.6 includes several new features and improvements for the Commit Graph:

The graph toolbar now includes a new _Create New Branch_ button in the upper-right corner that allows you to conveniently create a new branch (and worktree, if you prefer) from the current branch or commit. Furthermore, when your current branch is both ahead and behind its upstream, we've added a new _Force Push_ button to the toolbar next to the _Pull_ button that allows you to force push your current branch to its upstream (always force push with caution, as you may lose commits). These new buttons allow for easier entry into common branch workflows directly from the Commit Graph.

The Commit Graph sidebar is now enabled by default. You can disable it by setting `gitlens.graph.sidebar.enabled` to `false` in your settings.

Finally, we've improved the integration indicator and connection button on the upper left corner of the graph toolbar. The icon now more accurately reflects the hosting service for the current repository, and hovering over the connect button now provides some more context on the benefits of connecting the integration.

### Account View moved into Home View

The Account View has been moved into the bottom of the Home View as a new collapsible section. You can quickly jump into the Home View with the _GitLens: Show Home View_ command and expand the Account section to manage your account, cloud integrations and active organization, or leave it collapsed to view account status at a glance.

### Cursor Support

GitLens 15.6 improves support for GitLens in the Cursor editor. Cursor users can now take full advantage of GitLens commands, views and functionality, including account login and sign-up, within Cursor.

## Version 15.5

#### Thursday, September 12, 2024

GitLens 15.5 brings a few notable changes for the Commit Graph, current branches and worktree creation.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-15-5-hero.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### Launchpad Preview Ending

Preview access to Launchpad ends on September 27th. After this date, GitLens users will need a Pro account to continue accessing Launchpad and Launchpad View. The Launchpad status bar summary will continue to be free for everyone.

### Commit Graph Sidebar

We've equipped the Commit Graph with a sidebar which gives you quick and convenient access to branches, remotes, stashes, tags, and worktrees from within the graph. Clicking an icon from the sidebar will take you to its respective view. You can enable the new sidebar by setting `gitlens.graph.sidebar.enabled` to `true` in your settings.

### Current Branch Visibility

You now have the option to see your current branch at the top of the list anywhere local branches are shown in views. To enable this feature, turn on `gitlens.views.showCurrentBranchOnTop` in settings.

### Simplified Worktree Creation

We've streamlined the Create Worktree command flow, now prompting for a new branch name only when necessary. This simplifies the creation of worktrees from different sources.

### Added

- Adds a `gitlens.views.showCurrentBranchOnTop` setting to specify whether the current branch is shown at the top of the views &mdash; closes [#3520](https://github.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/issues/3520)
- Adds a sidebar to the _Commit Graph_
  - Shows counts of branches, remotes, stashes, tags, and worktrees
  - Clicking an item reveals it's corresponding view
  - Try out this new feature by enable the setting `gitlens.graph.sidebar.enabled` to `true`

### Changed

- Preview access of Launchpad is ending on September 27th
- Improves the branch comparisons in views to automatically select the base or target branch

### Fixed

- Fixes [#3514](https://github.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/issues/3514) - Attempting to delete the main worktree's branch causes a invalid prompt to delete the main worktree
- Fixes [#3518](https://github.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/issues/3518) - Branches in worktrees are no longer collapsed into folder groupings

### Removed

- Removes (disables) legacy "focus" editor

<a id="v15-4"></a>

## Version 15.4

#### Wednesday, September 4, 2024

GitLens 15.4 focuses on branches and worktrees, with icon, action, and tooltip upgrades that make the association between branches and worktrees clearer, improved cleanup when deleting a branch with a worktree or a worktree with a branch, improvements to comparisons, and more.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-15-4-hero.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### Worktee Enhancements

Branches in views and quick pick menus have received a few visual improvements to reduce clutter and make it easier to understand branch state. Branches with worktrees now display a repository icon instead of the typical branch icon, and the tooltip now also indicates that the branch is in a worktree. Branch tooltips now also split out information in a way that is easier to read.

### Branch & Worktree Cleanup Improvements

When a branch has an associated worktree, it is now easier to clean up the associated branch when deleting the worktree, and vice versa. Using the _Git Delete Worktree_ command on a worktree now also includes options to delete or force-delete both the worktree and its associated branch. Similarly, when deleting a branch that has a worktree, the user is first presented with options for deleting the branch's worktree before deleting the branch itself.

### Branch Comparison Improvements

On the _Commits_ view and nested within branches on the _Branches_ view, there is a comparison item to quickly compare the branch with another reference (branch, commit, tag, etc). In GitLens 15.4, we now automatically pick the "best" target branch as the default reference to compare with. Expand the _Ahead_ item to review your changes as they would be applied to the target branch.

### Commit Graph Search Additions

On the _Commit Graph_ (and commit search from the _Search & Compare_ view) you can now limit a search to only search within stashes. Use `type:stash` (or `is:stash`) to highlight all your stashes, or add it to a search query to limit the results to stashes.

### Added

- Adds better support for branches in worktrees
  - Changes the branch icon to a "repo" icon when the branch is in a worktree in views, quick pick menus, and the _Commit Graph_
  - Adds an _Open in Worktree_ inline and context menu command and an _Open in Worktree in New Window_ context menu command to branches and pull requests in views and on the _Commit Graph_
  - Removes the _Switch to Branch..._ inline and context menu command from branches in views and on the _Commit Graph_ when the branch is in a worktree
- Adds ability to only search stashes when using `type:stash` (or `is:stash`) in commit search via the _Commit Graph_, _Search & Compare_ view, or the _Search Commits_ command
- Adds `...` inline command for stashes on the _GitLens Inspect_ view
- Adds an "up-to-date" indicator dot to the branch icon of branches in views
- Adds an "alt" _Pull_ command for the inline _Fetch_ command on branches in views
- Adds an "alt" _Fetch_ command for the inline _Pull_ command on branches in views
- Adds _Open Comparison on Remote_ command to branch comparisons in views
- Adds new options to the _Git Delete Worktree_ command to also delete the associated branch along with the worktree

### Changed

- Improves the branch comparisons in views to automatically select the base or target branch
- Improves tooltips on branches, remotes, and worktrees in views
- _Upgrade to Pro_ flows now support redirects back to GitLens

### Fixed

- Fixes [#3479](https://github.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/issues/3479) - Tooltip flickering
- Fixes [#3472](https://github.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/issues/3472) - "Compare working tree with.." often flashes open then closes the menu
- Fixes [#3448](https://github.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/issues/3448) - "Select for Compare" on a Commit/Stash/etc causes the Search and Compare view to be forcibly shown
- Fixes the _Git Delete Branch_ command when deleting a branch that is open on a worktree by adding a step to delete the branch's worktree first
- Fixes an issue where pull requests in views could show the wrong comparison with the working tree when using worktrees
- Fixes _Copy Remote Comparison URL_ command to not open the URL, just copy it
- Fixes cloud integrations remaining disconnected after disconnecting and reconnecting to a GitKraken account
- Fixes "switch" deep links sometimes failing to complete in cases where the switch occurs in the current window

### Removed

- Removes status (ahead, behind, etc) decoration icons from branches in views

<a id="v15-3"></a>

## Version 15.3

#### Tuesday, August 13, 2024

GitLens 15.3 arrives with a host of improvements to popular GitLens features and commands. New branch filtering in the commit graph makes it easier to review history for branches with upstreams to improve pull request reviews. Launchpad has been expanded with GitLab support and is experimentally available as a view. GitHub virtual repositories now support comparisons, and some comparison commands now take a smarter approach to determining directionality of comparison, providing more relevant and useful results.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-15-3-hero.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### Commit Graph Branch Visibility

The Commit Graph now adds a third branch visibility option: Smart Branches. Existing options allowed you to show all branches or only the current branch (and its upstream). The new Smart Branches option shows the current branch, its upstream, and its base or target branch. This provides enough history to compare local branch changes with upstream changes on your current branch, and against changes with the merge base to determine, for example, whether a rebase is needed or if conflicts might occur. This option is particularly useful for workflows like pull request reviews.

Branch visibility options have now moved out of the graph filter dropdown and into a new branch visibility dropdown to the left of it in the graph header bar.

### Launchpad Improvements

#### GitLab in Launchpad

Launchpad now includes GitLab support! You can connect your GitLab integration and see GitLab merge requests alongside GitHub pull requests. We've also added a new _Connect Additional Integrations_ button to the titlebar of Launchpad that lets you easily connect additional integrations.

#### Launchpad View (Experimental)

We're experimenting with bringing Launchpad into a view so that you can keep it open and view pull request details at a glance, in a tree format. You can enable this experimental feature either by running the _Show Launchpad View_ command or setting `gitlens.views.launchpad.enabled` to `true` in your settings file.

### Comparison Improvements

When comparing commits, stashes, and tags with the HEAD commit via context menu commands, the comparison now uses a combination of commit topology and the timestamp of the reference and HEAD commit in order to determine the directionality of the comparison.

When comparing a commit with the HEAD commit, for example, we order the comparison from the HEAD commit to the chosen commit if it is ahead in time from the HEAD commit, and from the chosen commit to the HEAD commit if it is behind. This ensures that this command, now called _Compare to/from HEAD_, is more useful in general since the revision history within the comparison is always forward-looking.

Virtual repositories, such as GitHub repositories opened locally with the GitHub Repositories extension or on vscode.dev or github.dev, now also support comparison commands within views and the Commit Graph.

### Added

- Adds improvements and enhancements to _Launchpad_ to make it easier to manage and review pull requests
  - Adds GitLab (cloud-only for now) support to show and manage merge requests in _Launchpad_
  - Adds a new _Connect Additional Integrations_ button to the _Launchpad_ titlebar to allow connecting additional integrations (GitHub and GitLab currently)

    - While its functionality is currently limited, pull requests can be expanded to show changes, commits, and code suggestions, as well as actions to open changes in the multi-diff editor, open a comparision, and more
- Adds new features and improvements to the _Commit Graph_
  - Branch visibility options, formerly in the _Graph Filtering_ dropdown, are now moved to the new _Branches Visibility_ dropdown in the _Commit Graph_ header bar
  - Adds a new _Smart Branches_ visibility option to shows only relevant branches &mdash; the current branch, its upstream, and its base or target branch, to help you better focus
  - Improves interactions with hovers on rows &mdash; they should do a better job of staying out of your way
  - Adds pull request information to branches with missing upstreams
- Adds support for GitHub and GitLab cloud integrations &mdash; automatically synced with your GitKraken account
  - Adds an improved, streamlined experience for connecting cloud integrations to GitLens
  - Manage your connected integration via the the _Manage Integrations_ command or the _Integrations_ button on the _GitKraken Account_ view
- Adds comparison support to virtual (GitHub) repositories

### Changed

- Improves the _Compare to/from HEAD_ command (previously _Compare with HEAD_) to compare commits, stashes, and tags with the HEAD commit where directionality is determined by topology and time
- Improves the messaging of the merge and rebase commands
- Renames _Compare with Working Tree_ command to _Compare Working Tree to Here_
- Renames _Compare Common Base with Working Tree_ command to _Compare Working Tree to Common Base_

## Version 15.2

#### Wednesday, July 10th, 2024

GitLens 15.2 introduces several new features and improvements. This release focuses on enhancing the Commit Graph and Launchpad, expanding AI-generated messaging, and additional AI support for the latest Anthropic models.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-15-2-hero.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### Commit Graph Improvements

The Commit Graph now provides rich hovers on commit rows. These hovers include detailed commit information and links to related pull requests, issues, and linking to Inspect. We've also added pull request markers to the graph scroll and minimap, offering visual queues of PR activity in your repo history.

### Launchpad Improvements

We've added a new "Open Worktree in New Window" action to the Launchpad. This feature allows you to quickly open specific branches of pull requests in a separate VS Code window, minimizing context switching when working on multiple tasks.

### AI-Generated Descriptions

You can now generate titles and descriptions for Cloud Patches and Code Suggest. This is available using the "Generate Title & Description" button within the title input of the _Create Cloud Patch_ view and in the _Changes to Suggest_ section of the Inspect Overview tab. It uses the AI provider of your choice, helping to save time in creating meaningful titles and descriptions.

## Version 15.1

#### Wednesday, June 5th, 2024

We're excited to announce the latest release of GitLens, bringing you expanded AI capabilities, a better Launchpad experience, and bug fixes reported by our community.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-15-1-hero.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### GitHub Copilot and AI Model Integration

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-15-1-ai-models.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

GitLens now supports integration with GitHub Copilot and other VS Code extension-provided AI models for its experimental AI features. Simply select a model from the quickpick after choosing a GitLens AI action.

> You can also specify the AI model you want to use through the new `gitlens.ai.experimental.model` setting. When the model is set to `vscode`, specifying the `gitlens.ai.experimental.vscode.model` setting will target the VS Code extension-provided AI model you want to use.

To simplify the overall configuration of AI models, we have unified all settings under: `gitlens.ai.experimental.model`. This replaces the previous provider-specific settings, making it more straightforward to specify the AI model you want to use.

### Launchpad Enhancements

We've made several improvements to the Launchpad to provide a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. The collapsed state of Launchpad groups is now saved between uses, ensuring a consistent view across sessions. The Draft and Pinned categories in the Launchpad always sort their items by date, making it easier to find recent entries. The Launchpad status bar indicator now provides clear indications when there is an error loading data, keeping you informed of any issues. Additionally, we've improved loading performance and are continuing to look for ways to improve that in the future.

To leave us feedback such as what do you think, is this useful, what does it have that you like, what is it missing, etc. reach out to us on the GitLens [GitHub Discussion board](https://github.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/discussions/3286). We really want to hear your feedback!

## Version 15.0

#### Tuesday, May 14th, 2024

With the release of GitLens 15 comes some of GitLens' most exciting features yet, Launchpad, Code Suggest, Jira integration and so much more. This release is packed with tools and enhancements to improve code review workflows and makes it easier than ever to keep your team unblocked.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-15-hero.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### Launchpad

GitLens 15 introduces a preview of the Launchpad, a new Pro feature that brings your GitHub pull requests into a unified, categorized list. The Launchpad categorizes pull requests by status, making it easy to see which pull requests are ready to merge, blocked, need your review, and more. Use the Launchpad to quickly action on the highest priority pull requests and keep your team unblocked.

Once you've selected a pull request in the Launchpad, you can choose from a list of actions to take on that pull request, including merging the pull request, opening the pull request on GitHub, switching to or creating a branch or worktree for the pull request, viewing the pull request's changes, and more.

Also included is a Launchpad status bar icon which provides a pulse on the most critical pull request needing your attention, and a summary of your most critical pull requests on hover.

You can open the new Launchpad directly from its status bar icon by clicking the icon or by using the new _GitLens: Open Launchpad_ command. Clicking a category in the Launchpad status bar icon tooltip will open the Launchpad directly to that category.

### Code Suggest

Code Suggest is a new cloud feature that frees your code reviews from the unnecessary restrictions of GitHub's comment-style code suggestions. Code suggestions can be created from any code and right from inside the convenience of your IDE.

You can create a Code Suggestion from the _Inspect: Overview_ tab when on a PR's branch. You can also start Code Suggestions on a pull request directly from the Launchpad. Simply choose which file changes to include, add a title and optional description, and you're ready to go.

Upon creation of a Code Suggestion, a comment will appear on the pull request. Code Suggestions can be viewed and applied directly from [gitkraken.dev](https://gitkraken.dev?source=help_center&product=gitlens), or opened in GitKraken Desktop or GitLens.

You can see a PR's Code Suggestions from anywhere we currently display PR information in our views, including Commits, Branches, Remotes, and the new Pull Request view. From there you can view the changes, apply them, accept or reject the code suggestion, or copy a link to share with team members.

### Jira Integration

GitLens 15 introduces rich Jira Cloud integration, enabling automatic, rich Jira autolinks in commit messages wherever autolinks are supported in GitLens. You can connect to Jira by clicking the _Cloud Integrations_ button in the GitKraken Account view or by using the new _GitLens: Manage Cloud Integrations_ command. Once connected, rich autolinks will automatically populate for Jira issues in your commit messages.

Support for more cloud integrations and other Jira integration features are coming soon.

### Gemini and Latest OpenAI & Anthropic Model Support

This release also adds support for Google Gemini for GitLens' experimental AI features. You can specify the Gemini model to use with the new `gitlens.ai.experimental.gemini.model` setting.

We've also expanded our OpenAI and Anthropic model support to include the latest models.

## Version 14.9

#### Wednesday, March 6, 2024

The 14.9 release of GitLens brings improved reviewing of branch changes and new Anthropic Claude models along with general fixes and improvements.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-14-9-hero.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### Improved reviewing of Branch Changes

Two new commands were added to branches in the _Commit Graph_ and views. The `Compare with Common Base` enables reviewing changes as if the selected branch were to be merged by comparing the common ancestor (merge base) with the current branch to the selected branch. Use the new `Open All Changes with Common Base` command to review the changes as if the selected branch were to be merged in the multi-diff editor.

### Anthropic Claude Models

We've added support for Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus & Sonnet models for GitLens' experimental AI features. You can select these models from the `GitLens: Switch AI Model` command in the Command Palette. You can then use these models with the `GitLens: Generate Commit Message (Experimental)...` command in the Command Palette or in the `Explain (AI)` panel of _Commit Details_ and _Cloud Patch Details_ views.

### Added

- Adds support for Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus & Sonnet models for GitLens' experimental AI features
- Adds a _Compare with Common Base_ command to branches in the _Commit Graph_ and views to review the changes if the selected branch were to be merged by comparing the common ancestor (merge base) with the current branch to the selected branch
- Adds an _Open All Changes with Common Base_ command to branches in the _Commit Graph_ and views to review the changes if the selected branch were to be merged in the multi-diff editor
- Adds a _Stash All Changes_ command to Source Control repository toolbar (off by default)
- Adds the repository name as a prefix to worktree name when adding to the current workspace
- Adds a better message when stashing only untracked files without including untracked files

### Changed

- Re-adds _Add to Workspace_ option when creating a worktree &mdash; closes [#3160](https://github.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/issues/3160)
- Changes _Commit Graph_ date style to default to the default date style &mdash; refs [#3153](https://github.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/issues/3153)
- Renames the _Compare Ancestry with Working Tree_ command on branches to _Compare Common Base with Working Tree_ for better clarity
- Improves _File Blame_ annotations performance and layout accuracy with certain character sets

<a id="v14-8"></a>

## Version 14.8

#### Thursday, February 8, 2024

The 14.8 release of GitLens features several enhancements to make it easier to use worktrees, view diffs and pull-requests, and includes enterprise improvements for Cloud Patches.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-14-8-hero.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### Worktree Workflow Improvements `PRO`

We've improved and streamlined the process of creating and opening worktrees. This includes new options for creating a worktree when switching branches as well as skipping prompts for remote creating and just auto-adding them. We've also added a command for copying your current working changes to an existing worktree.

### VS Code Multi-diff Support

VS Code's new multi-diff editor is out of experimental, so we've enabled it in our commands by default for VS Code 1.86 and above. The multi-diff editor allows you to view changes across multiple files in a single tab, instead of switching between tabs. This makes comparing a set of changes across files much easier.

### Cloud Patch Enterprise Storage ‚òÅÔ∏è

For Enterprise customers, there is now the option to host Cloud Patches on your own dedicated storage for maximum security. Your organization's admin can configure the self-managed storage at [Security](https://gitkraken.dev/settings/security?source=help_center&product=gitlens). When creating a Cloud Patch, GitLens will confirm they are being stored on your secure organization storage.

## Version 14.7

#### Wednesday, January 16, 2024

With GitLens 14.7, we're kicking off 2024 with some bugfixes and some new features for Cloud Patches and Deep Links, and more.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-14-7-hero.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### Cloud Patch Collaboration ‚òÅÔ∏è

You can now add members of your GitKraken organization as collaborators on cloud patches you created or maintain as an admin. To invite a collaborator, click on one of your cloud patches in the _Cloud Patches_ view to open its patch details, and then click on the _Invite_ button. You can then select one or more members of your organization to add as collaborators on the patch. Once selected, you can choose a role for each collaborator, and click _Update Patch_ when done to finish adding collaborators.

Cloud patches you've been invited to as a collaborator appear under the _Shared with Me_ category in the _Cloud Patches_ view.

### Deep Links to Files and Code

You can now create (and use) deep links to files and code in GitLens. Create links to files using the new _Copy Link to File_ and _Copy Link to File at Revision..._ commands in the _Copy As_ submenu of the editor context menu and in the _Share_ submenu of files in GitLens views.

If you have code selected in an editor tab, you'll also have the option to link to the selected lines using the new _Copy Link to Code_ command in the _Copy As_ submenu of that tab's context menu.
Use or share these links to quickly and easily open the referenced file or code in an editor tab.

## Version 14.6

#### Wednesday, December 13, 2023

GitLens 14.6 marks our last release of 2023 and with it some great enhancements to Cloud Patches, Focus View and much more!

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-14-6-hero.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### Cloud Patch Sharing Options ‚òÅÔ∏è

Users can now specify who can access shared Cloud Patches, choosing between anyone with a link or only members of your GitKraken organization with the link.

Coming soon is the ability to explicitly select individuals from your organization as collaborators. Cloud Patches explicitly shared to you, i.e. you are a collaborator, will appear in the Cloud Patches view under "Shared with Me".

> Note: If you have multiple organizations, you can easily switch between them from the GitKraken Account view.

### Focus View Timed Snoozing

The focus view now supports timed snoozing of items. Select a duration like 1 hour or 4 hours when snoozing a focus item and then that item will automatically move back when the time expires.

### Experimental Multi-diff Editor

You can now open changes in VS Code's new multi-diff editor. This requires VS Code 1.85 or later with the `multiDiffEditor.experimental.enabled` and `gitlens.experimental.openChangesInMultiDiffEditor` settings enabled.

#### Commands using Multi-diff

- `Open Folder Changes with Revision...` and `Open Folder Changes with Branch or Tag...` commands using the Command Palette as well as the Explorer and Source Control views
- An inline `Open All Changes` command for commits, stashes, and comparisons in the views
- `Open All Changes` and `Open All Changes with Working Tree` will use the new multi-diff editor when enabled

> Note: `Open All Changes, Individually` and `Open All Changes with Working Tree, Individually` commands were added to provide access to the previous behavior.

## Version 14.4

#### Friday, October 13, 2023

GitLens 14.4 is here, featuring new enhancements to _Focus View_, the addition of _Working Changes_ to _Commit Details_ and _Graph Details_, and some performance improvements to _Inline_ and _Status Bar Blame_.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-14-4-hero.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### Focus View Enhancements

_Focus View_ now includes the ability to pin and snooze items. These options appear as clickable icons in the new snooze/pin column in the view. Pinned issues and pull requests will always show at the top of the list, while snoozed items will be hidden and moved to the new Snoozed section. To unsnooze an item, simply click on the Snoozed section header and select the unsnooze icon for that item in the pin/snooze column.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-14-4-focus-view-update.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### Working Changes Tab

_Commit Details_ and _Graph Details_ now include a separate _Working Changes_ tab. This allows you to view your work-in-progress changes any time without losing context on your current selected change. The tab includes the ability to stage and unstage changes, open files to view changes, and open the changes in the _Commit Graph_ and SCM view.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-14-4-commit-details-wip.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

## Version 14.3

#### Thursday, September 7, 2023

This release focuses on quality of life improvements to the _Commit Graph_, _Search & Compare_, and File History as well bug fixes around the deep links and viewing diffs.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-14-3-hero.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### Commit Graph Improvements

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-14-3-multiple-open-graphs.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

You can now have a Commit Graph in the bottom Panel and one in the Editor Area open at the same time. This enables viewing more than repo at a time or different areas of the same repo at the same time.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-14-3-commit-graph-prefers.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

Additionally, you can also set a preference for which mode to use by default, which you can set from the gear icon on the Commit Graph or by adding `gitlens.graph.layout` in settings. _GitLens: Show Commit Graph_ from the command palette will honor that preference.

### Search & Compare Review Checkboxes

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-14-3-search-compare-checkboxes.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

From the _Search & Compare_, you now have checkboxes next to each files to help keep track of files you've reviewed. This was an long sought after request by the community, you asked and we delivered!

GitLens 14.2 arrives with a few hotly-requested improvements to the Focus View for even greater productivity in your daily workflow.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-14-2-hero.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

## Focus View

The Focus View has been improved with a new unified experience and includes a few new features to help you navigate pull requests and issues.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-focus-changes-14-2.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

Pull Requests and Issues have now been combined into a single view with tabs to quickly toggle between showing all items, pull requests, or issues only.

You can also click on a branch name to show the branch on the Commit Graph, and if you don't already have a remote configured for that branch you'll be guided to add it.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-focus-search-14-2.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

Furthermore, we've added a search bar to the Focus View to help you quickly find pull requests or issues by their title.

<a id="v14-1"></a>

## Version 14.1

### Thursday, July 13, 2023

We're delighted to introduce GitLens 14.1. We've enhanced integration between GitKraken Cloud and VS Code workspaces. You can now link a GitKraken Cloud workspace and VS Code workspace and GitLens can automatically update your VS Code workspace when new repositories are added to its linked counterpart.
Additionally, we've added deep link support for comparisons in the _Search & Compare_ view, coupled with a new _Copy Link to Comparison_ command in a new _Share_ submenu, streamlining review and collaboration.

We've also added support for Anthropic's new Claude 2 model for use with our experimental AI features. You can switch to it using the _Switch AI Model_ command from the Command Palette.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-14-1-hero.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

## Workspace Linking

When you create a VS Code workspace from a GitKraken Cloud workspace, the two are now linked. You can open a linked VS Code workspace from its cloud workspace using the new _Open VS Code Workspace in New Window_ option (hold <kbd>alt</kbd> to open in the current window).

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-linked-workspaces-14-1.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

When repositories are added to a GitKraken Cloud workspace, you can automatically add those repositories to its linked VS Code workspace when that workspace is opened. You can choose to automatically add new repositories, be prompted to add them, or disable auto-adding repositories altogether for that workspace. You'll be prompted to choose your desired behavior when creating the VS Code workspace, but it can also be changed at any time via the _Change Linked Workspace Auto-Add Behavior..._ context menu command on the _Current Window_ item or its linked workspace in the _GitKraken Workspaces_ view.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-linked-auto-add-settings-14-1.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

You can also manually add repositories to the VS Code workspace at any time using the new _Add Repositories from Linked Workspace..._ context menu command.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-linked-add-repositories-14-1.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

## Comparison Deep Links

You can now deep link directly into comparisons in the _Search & Compare_ view. This includes comparisons between branches, tags, and commits. You can also copy a deep link to a comparison to your clipboard using the new _Copy Link to Comparison_ context menu command on the _Share_ submenu.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-deep-link-comparison-14-1.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

## Version 14.0 &mdash; GitLens Reimagined

### Wednesday, June 14, 2023

We're thrilled to announce the release of GitLens 14 with a reimagined GitLens experience! We restructured our views layout to better enhance productivity and focus by grouping views contextually, giving you easy access to the right information when you need it. The commit graph has been moved to the (bottom) panel, providing convenient and persistent access to the graph and its details. We've also rethought and rebuilt our Welcome and Walkthrough as well as the Home view to provide a friendlier onboarding experience.

The power of GitKraken Workspaces now in GitLens. Workspaces are an easy way to work with and manage multiple repositories and include the ability to convert to and from a VS Code workspace, with further improvements coming soon. Create workspaces just for yourself or share (coming soon to GitLens) them with your team for faster onboarding and better collaboration.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-14-0-hero.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

## New Views layout

We've grouped views contextually and introduced GitLens Inspect, giving you easy access to the right information when you need it. We've moved some of our views from their previous home, in Source Control, into either the GitLens or the new GitLens Inspect side bar.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-views-and-features.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### GitLens Inspect side bar

The all-new GitLens Inspect is like an x-ray or developer tools inspector into your code, which focuses on providing contextual information and insights to what you're actively working on.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-inspect-side-bar.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

Views include:

- Commit Details
- Line History
- File History
- Visual File History
- Search & Compare

_Pro tip: you can drag the entire GitLens Inspect Side Bar onto your secondary Side Bar, without needing to arrange views on-by-one._

### GitLens side bar

We've re-focused this to be the home of GitKraken services (e.g. GitKraken Workspaces) as well as discovery, help, and support.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-side-bar-v14.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

Views include:

- Home view
- GitKraken Workspaces
- GitKraken Account

### Source Control side bar

We've slimmed down this side bar to only contain views that are focused on your repositories.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-side-bar.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

Views include:

- Commits
- Branches
- Remotes
- Stashes
- Tags
- Worktrees
- Contributors
- Repositories (hidden by default)

### (Bottom) Panel

The new home for the Commit Graph, providing convenient and easy access to the graph and the new Commit Graph Details view.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-bottom-panel.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

Views include:

- Commit Graph
- Commit Graph Details

_Pro tip: You can toggle the Commit Graph between Panel and Editor layouts by clicking the "cog" icon on the upper right corner of the Graph view._
_Pro tip 2: When the Commit Graph is in the Panel Layout, you can quickly toggle it via the new **Toggle Commit Graph** and **Toggle Maximized Commit Graph** commands._

### Adopting the new views layout

Unless you opt into the new layout, which we recommend, your existing views will stay where they are. You can opt in at any time from _Reset Views Layout_ in the Command Palette.

## New Onboarding Experience

The rebuilt welcome goes beyond quick settings and now includes overviews of important features as well as bringing better visibility to the views and functionality GitLens offers. Along the same lines, we consolidated and streamlined our walkthroughs.

Also, we've made significant changes to the home view, with the help of your feedback, to refocus on quick access and discovery of many GitLens features.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è GitKraken Workspaces

GitKraken Workspaces are a convenient way to group and manage multiple repositories. Cloud workspaces store the metadata of the grouped repositories and can be accessed across machines and GitKraken products. They can easily be imported into or created from VS Code workspaces.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-workspaces-sidebar.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

Please note that while using cloud workspaces requires a free account, shared cloud workspaces, which are shared between GitKraken organizations and teams, require a trial or plan. Shared Workspaces functionality is coming soon to GitLens.

Workspaces can be accessed in the new GitKraken Workspaces view in the GitLens side bar.

## Commit Graph Enhancements `PRO`

We‚Äôve greatly improved the ease of access to the Commit Graph as well as additional change information and easy-to-use customization options.

### New Home in (Bottom) Panel

The Commit Graph has moved into the (bottom) panel, providing convenient and persistent access to the graph and its details. If you prefer the Graph in the editor area, you can toggle between Panel and Editor layouts by clicking the "cog" icon on the upper right corner of the Graph view.

### Minimap and Markers

The Minimap which shows an overview of commit activity, previously an experimental feature, is now on by default. You can now toggle between 'lines changed' and 'commits' in the minimap display.

With both the Minimap and the Commit Graph scrollbar, you can toggle specific markers on and off, including local branch, remote branch, stash, and tag markers. For the minimap, use the split minimap button, and for the scrollbar use the `Scroll Markers` submenu from the "cog" icon at the top of the scrollbar.

### New Column and Column Layout

The _Changes_ column, which shows the size of commit changes, is now visible by default. The column now also includes a count of the changed files, helping you quickly grasp the scale of each change.

Reset your columns between the _Default_ and the new _Compact_ set via the context menu on the graph column headers, making it easy to toggle into a more minimal experience.

## Version 13.6

### Thursday, May 11, 2023

GitLens 13.6 brings a range of enhancements and additions to the Commit Graph and refinements to our context menus. We've made improvements to the layout, condensing author names and column titles into avatars and icons when sized to minimums, and added flexibility of rearranging and moving columns as desired. This allows for a more streamlined and personalized GitLens experience. We have also updated the Commit Graph's toolbar to dynamically show a Push or Pull action, depending on a branch's state in relation to its upstream remote.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-13-6-hero.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

## Context Menu Updates

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-13-6-context-menu-update.gif" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

To improve structure and findability of our menu options, we‚Äôve made several changes to our context menus. Many Copy Remote URL commands, which were previously in a Copy As submenu, have been moved to a Share submenu within GitLens views, which aligns with VS Code menus. And once [microsoft/vscode#176316](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/176316) lands we will move the rest of the Copy Remote URL commands into the appropriate Share submenu. This reorganization consolidates related commands and makes it easier to locate and utilize them.

Similarly, the Copy SHA and Copy Message commands, previously nested in submenus, have been promoted to the root of the context menu. This elevates their visibility and enables quick access for performing actions on commits. Additionally, the Copy Relative Path command has been relocated to the root of the context menu. These adjustments enhance convenience when working with file paths.

### Commit Graph Enhancements `PRO`

We‚Äôve made it easier to customize your Commit Graph experience as well as improvements for better readability when in compact layouts.

#### Compact Graph Improvements

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-13-6-graph-customize-columns.gif" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

Previously unmovable columns within the Commit Graph can now be rearranged and customized according to your preferences. This flexibility enables you to arrange the columns in a way that best suits their workflow and priorities.

In addition, we have implemented a more compact layout by removing the commit icon when avatars are hidden. This optimization maximizes the utilization of screen space and results in a cleaner and more streamlined visual representation.

Moreover, the Author column now displays avatars instead of text when sized to its minimum width. That combined with the compact layout for the Graph column provide a nice compact experience with no loss of fidelity.

#### Column Headers

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-13-6-graph-show-hide-columns.gif" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

Commit Graph column headers have received dynamic behavior for enhanced readability. When the Commit Graph columns are compacted, the column headers seamlessly switch from displaying text to icons. This adaptation ensures that crucial information remains visible, even in constrained display settings.

### Stash Improvements

We've added the ability to rename stashes. If you are like me and often stash changes in a rush with very poor names, e.g. "wip" and then kick yourself later for not providing a more descriptive name, the this feature is for you. You can now rename any stash at any time.

You can now search within stashes using the Commit Graph, the Search & Compare view, or the Search Commits command. This improvement facilitates efficient navigation and retrieval of specific stash entries.

### Added

  - Automatically switches column headers from text to icons when the column's width is too small for the text to be useful
  - Automatically switches the Author column to shows avatars rather than text when the column is sized to its minimum width
- Adds the ability to search stashes when using the commit search via the _Commit Graph_, _Search & Compare_ view, or the _Search Commits_ command
- Adds an _Open Visual File History_ command to the new _File History_ submenu on existing context menus
- Allows the _Repositories_ view for virtual repositories
- Honors the `git.repositoryScanIgnoredFolders` VS Code setting

## Version 13.5

### Thursday, Apr 6, 2023

With 13.5, we've added the ability to switch to an alternate panel layout for the Commit Graph, which moves the Commit Graph into the bottom panel and adds a new Commit Graph Details view alongside on the right, for more convenient and persistent access. You can now also switch to a compact layout for the Graph column and shrink the Branch / Tag column to a single icon to reduce the space and allow you to focus on what you deem most important. You can now take action on your pull requests in the Focus View, with the new ability to create or switch branches or worktrees. We've also heard your feedback that the Commit Details view pinning was confusing and hard to work with, so 13.5 includes many improvements to make that experience better. We've also continued our quest to reduce the size and improve performance of GitLens and have shaved another ~7% off the GitLens bundle.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-13-5-hero.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### Commit Graph Layouts `PRO`

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-commit-graph-panel-layout-view.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

The new panel layout brings even more flexibility and customization options to GitLens. While using the panel layout, GitLens moves the Commit Graph into the bottom panel and adds a new Commit Graph Details view alongside on the right. If the layout in the bottom panel doesn't suit your needs you can move the Commit Graph around to other locations (side bar, secondary side bar, etc) to suit your preferences. Whether you prefer to have the Commit Graph in the editor or in a separate panel, GitLens makes it easy to switch and find the layout that works best for you.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-commit-graph-panel-layout-change.gif" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

To switch to the panel layout, simply click on the Commit Graph settings cog located at the top right of the Commit Graph. From there, select the "Switch Commit Graph to Panel Layout" option, and if you want to switch back follow the same steps and choose "Switch Commit Graph to Editor Layout".

#### Compact Graph Column Layout

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-commit-graph-compact-graph.gif" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

With the new compact Graph column layout, GitLens provides a more streamlined and compact layout to reduce the space required to visualize the commit history and branch relationships.

To enable the new compact Graph Column layout, right click on the Graph column header, and select the "Compact Graph Column Layout" option. If you want to switch back follow the same steps and choose "Default Graph Column Layout".

#### Pull Requests on Local Branches

You can now see pull requests (PRs) for your local branch upstreams directly on the local branches themselves. You no longer have to hunt for the local branch's upstream on the Commit Graph to see the associated PR.

#### Publish Local Branches from Commit Graph

Publishing local branches directly from the Commit Graph is a nice productivity boost. You can quickly and easily publish your local changes without having to switch to the Branches view or use the command line.

### Focus View Pull Request Actions `PRO`

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-focus-view-create-worktree-create-branch.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

The Focus View is no longer read-only! We've introduced new actions within Focus View, aimed at enhancing your workflow and productivity. You can now easily create a branch or worktree, or switch/open an existing one, for a PR directly from the Focus View page, streamlining the process of reviewing or contributing to pull requests. As a quick worktree refresher, creating a worktree from the PR will let you review or contribute to multiple PRs simultaneously without affecting your current branch and working tree.

### Commit Details Interaction Improvements

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-commit-details-pinned-commit-deets.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

We've heard your feedback on the Commit Details view and the confusion and difficulty with using the pinning feature. We updated the visual appearance of the pinned state, so its easier to know when Commit Details is pinned. Additionally, we've introduced navigation controls that enable you to move back and forth through the commits you've recently viewed, helping to avoid losing context as you navigate through your code.

## Version 13.4

### Thursday, Mar 16, 2023

With 13.4, we've introduced an experimental new AI feature to assist with writing commit messages, improved GitLens performance by reducing its size, made improvements to the `PRO` Commit Graph, and accepted community contributions as well as many bug fixes from community feedback.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-13.4-banner.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### AI-Generated Commit Messages (Experimental)

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-ai-generated-commit-message.gif" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

We‚Äôve introduced a new experimental feature to assist with writing commit messages by leveraging OpenAI. To start, stage some changes you want to commit and generate a commit message for and then run the ‚ÄúGenerate Commit Message (Experimental)‚Äù command from the Command Palette. From there you will be guided through the process of accepting to send the diff of your staged changes to OpenAI and the entry of your OpenAI key. Once completed, the generated commit message will be entered into the commit input box on the Source Control sidebar. You can also enter additional context about your changes in the commit box and those will also be sent to help generate a better message.

Additionally, you can customize the `gitlens.experimental.generateCommitMessagePrompt` setting to control the prompt used to structure and format the generated commit message. You could have it structure commit messages in the conventional commit style, or you can have fun with it and make your commit messages in the style of a pirate, Shakespeare, etc.

This is a very early peek into features and ideas that can leverage AI ‚Äì look forward to much more in the near future!

### GitLens Size Reduction

Over the last couple releases we‚Äôve made significant progress on optimizing the footprint of GitLens. We‚Äôve focused a lot on the bundle sizes to allow for faster start-up times of both the extension itself and all of our webviews. These optimizations also help reduce our memory usage. We are continually looking for opportunities to optimize and reduce our footprint so look for more progress in the future!

Here are some numbers:

- GitLens desktop bundle has been reduced by ~37% from 1.91MB to 1.21MB
- GitLens web bundle (for vscode.dev / github.dev) has been reduced by ~39% from 2.05MB to 1.24MB
- GitLens Commit Graph webview has been reduced by ~27% from 1.03MB to 758KB and that is including the new minimap and rich scroll markers
- GitLens Home view has been reduced by ~41% from 267KB to 160KB
- GitLens Visual File History view has been reduced by ~9% from 508KB to 461KB

### Commit Graph Enhancements `PRO`

##### Upstream Tracking

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-upstream-tracking.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

It's now possible to effortlessly keep track of upstreams of your local branches in the commit graph. The upstreams of visible local branches, along with their corresponding commit history, will be displayed in the graph even if other remote branches are filtered out from your settings.

We've also revised the wording of the remote filter setting to "Hide Remote-only Branches.

#### Graph Alignment

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-graph-alignment.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

The graph column is now more left-aligned, making it easier to read and follow the history of a branch at a glance.

#### Branches and Tags on Remote Repositories

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-remote-ref-tracking.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

You can now see the tips of your branches and tags in the Commit Graph on remote repositories! Previously, opening a remote repository in the graph would show only the current branch. Currently, we are still limited to only showing commits for the current branch, so the included branches and tags are ones pointing to commits in the current branch‚Äôs commit history.

### Sunsetting GitLens Insiders (Replaced with Pre-release)

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-sunsetting-insiders.gif" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

We‚Äôve deprecated the GitLens Insiders edition in favor of a Pre-release version which is directly supported inside VS Code and is much easier to opt-in to and out of. Existing users of GitLens Insiders should have been automatically migrated to the Pre-release version. The Pre-release version of GitLens is a nightly build of GitLens, just as the GitLens Insiders edition was.

To opt-in to the Pre-release edition, select GitLens from the extensions sidebar and press ‚ÄúSwitch to Pre-Release Version‚Äù.

## Version 13.3

### Thursday, Feb 23, 2023

Supercharge your Git game with GitLens 13.3: the latest update to help you master Git like a pro. With 13.3 we‚Äôre introducing Workspace Focus View, Deep Linking Support, and Commit Graph Improvements featuring the new (experimental) minimap and changes column.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/glrn-13.3.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

GitLens also just got a whole lot faster with the release of version 13.3! Thanks to some serious bundle slimming, the startup times have significantly improved.

- GitLens' extension bundle for desktop (node) is now ~18% smaller
- GitLens' extension bundle for web (vscode.dev/github.dev) is now ~37% smaller
- GitLens' Commit Graph webview bundle is now ~31% smaller

### Focus View (Preview) `PRO`

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/glrn-focus-view.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

With the preview of GitLens Focus View, you can streamline your workflow and prioritize your tasks with ease. The Focus View feature gives you a comprehensive list of all your most important work across all your GitHub repos. No more jumping back and forth between multiple pages or repos - GitLens Focus View makes it simple and efficient to keep track of and manage your work progress.

The new Focus View will provide you with a summary of Pull Requests and Issues relevant to you for the repositories grouped in your Workspace.

- My Pull Requests: shows all GitHub PRs opened by you, assigned to you, or awaiting your review
- My Issues: shows all issues created by you, assigned to you, or that mention you.

Instead of hunting for these pieces of information separately, you can get a holistic view of what you‚Äôre working on.

\*_Note Focus View is currently in a Preview Only state, it is subject to change in the future._

### Commit Graph improvements `PRO`

#### Minimap (Experimental)

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/glrn-minimap.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

Click the Toggle Minimap icon in the right corner of the Commit Graph top bar to toggle the Minimap on and off. As this is an experimental feature, it is off by default ‚Äì and we would love to hear your feedback and suggestions.

The idea behind the Minimap is to provide a whole new dimension to the Commit Graph. You can quickly see the activity of the repo, see HEAD/upstream, branches (local and remote), and easily jump to them.

The <span style="color:green">green line</span> showcases HEAD while search results are depicted by <span style="color:yellow">yellow lines</span>. The highlighted region shows the Commit Graph area that is in view. Markers are arranged in two rows of stacked blocks:

- In the upper row, the <span style="color:green">blue blocks</span> signify remote branches, while the <span style="color:brown">brown blocks</span> refer to tags.
- Within the lower row, the <span style="color:pink">pink blocks</span> denote stashes, and the <span style="color:blue">blue blocks</span> represent local branches.

We really want to hear your feedback - this is still a very early feature and we're currently still playing with colors, and additional features. To leave us feedback such as what do you think, is this useful, what does it have that you like, what is it missing, etc. reach out to us on the GitLens, [GitHub Discussion board](https://github.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/discussions/2477#discussion-4807133).

#### Changes column (lines added/deleted)

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/glrn-changes-column.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

Reduce time and effort required to navigate through code changes, with the changes column in GitLens. The changes column provides a visual representation of changes made to files in each commit, with green bars indicating added lines and red bars indicating deleted lines.

This visual display allows you to quickly identify the extent of changes made to files across multiple commits, making it easier to pinpoint specific areas of code that have been modified.

You can toggle the Change Column by right clicking the graph header and clicking "Show Changes".

#### Scroll Markers (Rich scrollbar)

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/glrn-rich-scrollbar.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

Scroll Markers adds a rich layer of information to the Commit Graph scrollbar. Now you can quickly find and jump to checked-out branches, selected rows, search results, as well as important points such as HEAD and refs. Similar to Overview Ruler in VS Code, Scroll Markers provide a visual indicator on the scrollbar.

Our intention with Scroll Markers is to save you time and effort by allowing you to quickly identify and jump to the relevant sections of your Git history. It's a powerful new addition to the Commit Graph to help streamline workflow.

#### Branch upstream status

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/glrn-branch-upstream.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

The Commit Graph now shows the upstream status of local branches with an upstream. You'll be able to quickly identify when your local branch is out of sync with its upstream branch with the new indicator, which shows how many commits are ahead or behind your upstream branch.

You can also double-click on the upstream indicator, to pull or push the pending commits to bring your local branch back in sync with its upstream. This makes it easy to keep track of upstream changes to your local branches and keep them up to date.

#### Work In Progress Row improvements

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/glrn-wip.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

With the latest Work In Progress Row improvements, with a single right click, you can access the WIP contextual menu. Giving you access to a range of useful options, including Stash All Changes, Open Details, and Open Source Control. These features allow you to more effectively manage your WIP.

### Deep linking support

Deep linking provides you with the ability to easily share specific remote repositories, commits, branches, and tags by copying the link to your clipboard and pasting it into a Jira issue or a Slack conversation for example.

The link will then open in the Commit Graph and can be used to quickly access and review relevant artifacts. With deep linking support, you can improve collaboration and communication by seamless sharing of important information related to your Git repos.

## Version 13.2

### Tuesday, Dec 20th, 2022

Since the release of [GitLens 13](https://www.gitkraken.com/blog/gitlens-13), we know how the power of GitLens Pro features like the Commit Graph, have been helping supercharge your dev workflow. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre excited to present GitLens 13.2, with all new (and highly requested) Graph improvements like filtering, to quickly focus on what is most important to you. We've also streamlined the Commit Graph interface with a new header bar, providing context and quick access to switch between repositories or branches, and even fetch to keep up to date. Get ready to level up your Git game with GitLens 13.2!

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gitlens-13.2-hero.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### Filtering

GitLens 13.2 introduces filtering , which allows you to display a subset of your graph‚Äôs information and helps you hone in on specific details of your graph that matter the most.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gitlens-filter-options.gif" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

#### Filtering Capabilities

Use graph filtering in GitLens to get laser focused on the branch you're working on and its remote:

- Only Show the Current Branch

  - Display only the branch that you‚Äôre currently working on and it‚Äôs remote. In order to focus your attention on the things landing in this branch, and then quickly unfilter to "zoom" back out and see everything in flight.

- Hide Remote Branches

  - Hides commits from the graph view that are only on remote branches.

- Hide Tags

  - Hides all tags that point to commit rows.

- Hide Stashes

  - Hides all stash rows.

- Dim Merge Commit Rows
  - Deemphasizes merge commit rows.

### Graph UX Improvements

We've updated the user interface, so you can get to all your favorite features even faster. Now, you can access change repo, account status, and filtering from the top of the Commit Graph page.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/graph-ux-improvements.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### Header Updates

By merging the contextual information from the footer into the header, including the new Branch Picker and Fetch Action we‚Äôve made it easier for you to manage your branches and work more effectively.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/drop-down.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

- Branch Picker

  - Save time, by easily selecting the branch you want from the drop down branch picker.

- Fetch Action
  - Easily keep your local repo up-to-date and in sync with the fetch action.

### Shortcut Keys

Using the new keyboard shortcuts, `SHIFT+UP` and `SHIFT+DOWN` on the Commit Graph helps you locate what you need more efficiently and effectively by staying within the branch and moving between graph rows. This can be particularly useful if you are working on a complex project with many branches.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/shift-up-down.gif" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/atmegif.gif" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

## Faster Interactive Rebase Editor

With GitLens 13.1, we overhauled the Interactive Rebase Editor. It is now dramatically faster, especially for large rebases. We also streamlined the user experience with a persistent header and footer to ensure you always have important context visible and can quickly start or abort the rebase. Also, anytime the commit author and committer are different, you will see both of their avatars.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/Faster-Interactive-Rebase-Editor.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### Commit Details View Usage

Need additional details to complete your rebase more efficiently? Now, as you navigate commits, we show the selected commit details in the Commit Details view.

## Commit Details View Improvements

### Custom Autolinks

Custom and basic provider-based autolinks are now shown in the Autolinks section.

### Customizable Settings

You can now customize the Commit Details view from the GitLens Settings editor to personalize how it looks and behaves so you can focus on the most important details.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/commit-details-view-1.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

## Terminal Links Can Use the Commit Details View

Terminal Links for commits in VS Code‚Äôs integrated terminal now use the Commit Details view to provide rich details about the selected commit.

## GitLens Home View Updates

Keeping a home tidy is important! We‚Äôve streamlined the Home view to make it even easier to get started with GitLens, learn about its features, and how to personalize your experience.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/New-Home-Side-Panel.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

## Version 13.0

### Monday, October 17th, 2022

Find what you seek.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gitlens-13-social-3x.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

## GitLens Pro Features for All on Local & Public Repos `PRO`

With GitLens 13.0, we are excited to bring the power of GitLens Pro features like the Commit Graph, Visual File History, and Worktrees to ALL users on local and public repos. No account required. Learn more about the changes happening with GitLens in this [article](https://www.gitkraken.com/blog/gitlens-13).

Here‚Äôs how to get started with each of the GitLens Pro features with your local or public repos:

- [Commit Graph](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitlens/gitlens-plus/#commit-graph)
- [Worktrees](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitlens/gitlens-plus/#worktrees)
- [Visual File History](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitlens/gitlens-plus/#visual-file-history)

## Commit Graph - Now out of Preview! `PRO`

We‚Äôre delighted to announce that the Commit Graph is out of Preview, and is full featured! This means you may now interact with the Commit Graph directly and take actions like:

- Interact with branches, commits, tags and more with right-click context menus
- Double click a branch to checkout a branch
- Search and filter for commits
- Get information about Pull Requests

### Full context menu support

Interact with your branches, commits, and more! Context menus are now available when you right click on any branch, tag, commit, or author in the Commit Graph. You may even interact with the Commit Graph column headers to the author, date or SHA columns. So much power!

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/Commit-Search-Context-Menus.gif" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

Context menu actions include but are not limited to:

- Switch to Branch
- Revert Commit
- Switch to Commit
- Create Branch
- Merge
- Rebase
- Create Worktree
- Create Pull Request

### Rich commit search

Find exactly what you are looking for with the rich search on the powerful new Commit Graph.

Whether searching for a specific commit, message, author, a changed file or files, or even a specific code change, the Commit Graph will highlight matching results across your entire repository. Use shortcut keys or the up/down arrows on the search bar to navigate the search results; `F3` (also `Cmd+G` on macOS) goes to the next result from your selection while `Shift+F3` ( also `Shift+Cmd+G` on macOS) goes to the previous. Additionally you can quickly jump to the first or last result, by holding `Shift` while clicking on the up/down arrows respectively ‚Äì to make it easy to see when a file or change was introduced into the codebase.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/Rich-Commit-Search.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

Once you type search filtering criteria, use the arrow icons to move through each result.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/Commit-Search-Moving-Arrow-Keys.gif" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### PR information in form of icon

Wait, which branch has that PR?

If connected to one of the rich integrations with GitHub or GitLab, the Commit Graph will display a PR icon for any branch currently in PR. Right-click on the PR icon to open the PR on the GitHub or GitLab, or copy the URL.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/PR-Icon.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### Hiding remotes, branches or tags

Need to focus and have too many remotes or just want to curate how much is shown in your Commit Graph? Now you can hide entire remotes, or specific branches and tags. Hover over any branch or tag to access the ‚ÄúHide‚Äù button or right-click to hide the whole remote, or just the local or remote branch, to help focus your Commit Graph.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/Branch-Hide.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### All new home view

It‚Äôs a homecoming! Our GitLens home view has a new look, with quick links to our Getting Started guides, Integrations, Trial info, and Feature spotlights.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/GitLens-Home.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### List or tree view in Commit Details View

The Commit Details View, which gives you contextual change info about your code, got a new toggle for List and Tree view.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/view-as-list.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

To open the Commit Details view, open the command palette using <kbd>Cmd+Shift+P</kbd> and type: Show Commit Details view or navigate to the Commit Details view in the Side Bar.

## Version 12.2

### Tuesday, August 30th, 2022

The new Commit Graph üé® in GitLens 12.2 will fix all your commitment problems...in your code ü•Å üë©‚Äçüíª

<div class='embed-container embed-container--16-9'>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EsnA4zIUvWY?controls=1&modestbranding=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

## Commit Graph - Preview `PRO`

Users may now view the Commit Graph of their repository through GitLens.

This beloved feature from GitKraken Desktop helps visualize your repo commit history and give you information about branches, commits, and collaborators all in one view ‚Äî making it easier to see contributions and help you make faster, more informed decisions.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/1-commit-graph.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

To open the Commit Graph, open the command palette using the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Cmd</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>P</kbd> and type `Show Commit Graph`.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2-commit-graph.gif" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

This will open a new tab and render your current repo‚Äôs commit history, where you may scroll through your history and resize any of the columns widths.

You may also access the Commit Graph by clicking this graph icon from the Source Control view in the Sidebar or Status Bar.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/How-to-open-commit-graph-B.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

The Commit Graph is available to all users working on public repositories, and requires no account. Additionally, users with a paid GitLens Pro subscription can use the Commit Graph with private repos.

For those on [vscode.dev](vscode.dev) or [github.dev](github.dev), this also means you can open the Commit Graph on a web browser.

The Commit Graph is in `Preview` mode, and we‚Äôd love to hear your feedback in the [Commit Graph discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/discussions/2158).

## Commit Details View

GitLens 12.2 also ships with a `Commit Details View`, which gives you contextual change info about your code.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/3-commit-details-view.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

To open the `Commit Details View`, open the command palette using <kbd>Cmd</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>P</kbd> and this time type: `Show Commit Details View` or navigate to the Commit Details View in the Sidebar.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/4-commit-details-view.gif" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

The `Commit Details View` updates as you move your cursor throughout the file with information about the commit that modified that line of code. Get quick information about the commit author, commit ID, links to Pull Requests, files modified in the commit, and more.

Click on a file to open the diff, and see what changed. You may also hover over the file name to access options like Open File, Open Changes with Working File, and Open Remote.

## GitHub Enterprise Integration `PRO`

Next, GitLens Pro now offers a richer integration with GitHub Enterprise.

Once authenticated, GitLens will enrich GitHub autolinks in the hovers. You‚Äôll see your GitHub Enterprise avatar, links to related pull requests, along with a footnote of the pull request or issue details.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/6-GitHub-Enterprise.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

You‚Äôll see similar details from the Sidebar views for any commit or branch associated with a pull request or issue.

## Single Sign On `PRO`

Single Sign On is here, providing GitLens Pro users with a more secure sign in method!

### Requirements and configuration

Your GitKraken account may now initiate an Oauth authentication flow with the following supported Identity Providers (IdPs):

- Azure Active Directory
- Okta
- Google Identity Platform
- Ping Identity

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/SSO-setup.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

Please note that your IdP will first need to be configured before setting up the connection in your GitKraken account. For assistance, please contact your IdP administrator or consult the IdP documentation for help.

Additional requirements: - Configurable only by GitKraken Owner or Admin of an organization - Subscribed to either the Teams or Enterprise plan

‚Üí [Documentation: How to set up SSO in GitKraken](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitkraken-client/single-sign-on/)

### Signing in with SSO

GitLens Pro users should see a new option to Sign in with SSO from the login screen.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/9-GitLens-SSO.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

After clicking `Sign in with SSO`, the SSO form will open and ask for an email address to use for SSO login. The app will then check the email and determine whether the email address belongs to a single IdP for SSO. When the email address is successfully identified, the user will be taken to that IdP to login.

Once authenticated, the user may use GitLens Pro

## More improvements

### Stash naming defaults

When applying or popping a stash, GitLens will default the commit message input to the stash message.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/10-stash-commit-message.gif" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

And when stashing changes, the stash name will now default to any entry in the commit message input.

### Stats in comparisons

There are now stats about additions & deletions in files nodes in comparisons. To get these stats, navigate to the `Search & Compare` view in the Sidebar and create a comparison between commits.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/11-comparison-stats.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">

### Search for text in Interactive Rebase Editor

And users may now search for text on the `Interactive Rebase Editor` using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>F</kbd>.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/12-interactive-rebase-text-search.png" class="help-center-img img-bordered">
