##Remote Provider Integrations
GitLens provides rich integrations with many remote providers, including GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, Gitea, Gerrit, Bitbucket, Bitbucket Server, and Azure DevOps. You can also define [custom remote providers](/gitlens/settings/#remote-provider-integration-settings) or [remote providers with custom domains](/gitlens/settings/#remote-provider-integration-settings) as well.

Basic integrations provide issue and pull request auto-linking, while richer integrations (e.g. GitHub) can provide rich hover information provided for auto-linked issues and pull requests, associate pull requests with branches and commits, and provide avatars.

Additionally, these integrations provide commands to copy the url of or open, files, commits, branches, and the repository on the remote provider.

- Open _File from Remote_ command (`gitlens.openFileFromRemote`) — opens the local file from a url of a file on a remote provider
- Open _File on Remote_ command (`gitlens.openFileOnRemote`) — opens a file or revision on the remote provider
- Copy _Remote File Url_ command (`gitlens.copyRemoteFileUrlToClipboard`) — copies the url of a file or revision on the remote provider
- Open _File on Remote From..._ command (`gitlens.openFileOnRemoteFrom`) — opens a file or revision on a specific branch or tag on the remote provider
- Copy _Remote File Url From... command (`gitlens.copyRemoteFileUrlFrom`) — copies the url of a file or revision on a specific branch or tag the remote provider
- Open _Commit on Remote_ command (`gitlens.openCommitOnRemote`) — opens a commit on the remote provider
- Copy _Remote Commit Url_ command (`gitlens.copyRemoteCommitUrl`) — copies the url of a commit on the remote provider
- Open _Branch on Remote_ command (`gitlens.openBranchOnRemote`) — opens the branch on the remote provider
- Copy _Remote Branch Url_ command (`gitlens.copyRemoteBranchUrl`) — copies the url of a branch on the remote provider
- Open _Branches on Remote_ command (`gitlens.openBranchesOnRemote`) — opens the branches on the remote provider
- Copy _Remote Branches Url_ command (`gitlens.copyRemoteBranchesUrl`) — copies the url of the branches on the remote provider
- Open _Comparison on Remote_ command (`gitlens.openComparisonOnRemote`) — opens the comparison on the remote provider
- Copy _Remote Comparison Url_ command (`gitlens.copyRemoteComparisonUrl`) — copies the url of the comparison on the remote provider
- Open _Pull Request_ command (`gitlens.openPullRequestOnRemote`) — opens the pull request on the remote provider
- Copy _Pull Request Url_ command (`gitlens.copyRemotePullRequestUrl`) — copies the url of the pull request on the remote provider
- Open _Repository on Remote_ command (`gitlens.openRepoOnRemote`) — opens the repository on the remote provider
- Copy _Remote Repository Url_ command (`gitlens.copyRemoteRepositoryUrl`) — copies the url of the repository on the remote provider

###Connecting the GitHub Integration

To connect the GitHub integration, open a GitHub.com repository in Visual Studio Code. Then, select a file and hover over the line blame to get the details hover. From here, select `Connect to GitHub`.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-connect-to-github.png" class="img-bordered img-responsive center">

If you are prompted to sign in using GitHub, select `Allow`.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gh-sign-in.png" class="img-bordered img-responsive center">

Finally, you will be taken to a browser where you will be prompted to sign into GitHub and `Authorize Visual-Studio-Code` to finish connecting. 

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gh-authorize.png" class="img-bordered img-responsive center">

###Connecting the GitLab Integration

To connect the GitLab integration, open a GitLab.com repository in Visual Studio Code. Then, select a file and hover over the line blame to get the details hover. From here, select the option to `Connect to GitLab`.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gl-connect-to-gitlab.png" class="img-bordered img-responsive center">

Next, you will be prompted to provide a Personal Access Token from GitLab.com. If you do not have one already with the required scopes, [follow these instructions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html) to create one. The required scopes for the token are `read_api`, `read_user`, and `read_repository`. Once you have your token, copy and paste it into the prompt and hit `Enter` to finish connecting.

##Menus & Toolbars

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/menus.png" class="img-bordered img-responsive center">

GitLens provides [customizable](/gitlens/gitlens-settings/#elementor-toc__heading-anchor-16) menu and toolbar contributions to put you in control over where GitLens' commands are shown. The easiest way to configure these settings is via the GitLens [interactive settings editor](/gitlens/gitlens-settings/).

For example, if you uncheck the _Add to the editor group toolbar_ you will see the following items removed from the toolbar:

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/menus-example.png" class="img-bordered img-responsive center">

You can also expand each group to control each area more granularly.

##Commit Details View

The Commit Details View gives you contextual change info about your code. This view updates as you move your cursor throughout the file with information about the commit that modified that line of code. Get quick information about the commit author, commit ID, links to Pull Requests, files modified in the commit, and more.

Click on a file to open the diff, and see what changed. You may also hover over the file name to access options like Open File, Open Changes with Working File, and Open Remote.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/commit-details-view.png" class="img-bordered img-responsive center">

To open the Commit Details View, open the command palette using `Cmd/ctrl + Shift + P` and type: “Show Commit Details View” or navigate to the Commit Details View in the sidebar.
