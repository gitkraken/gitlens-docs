The GitLens **Worktrees** view lets you create, view, and manage [worktrees](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/git-worktree). Worktrees allow you to check out multiple branches of the same repository at the same time.  

This makes it easier to develop or test different branches in parallel while minimizing the context switching between them.  

You can also [customize Worktrees settings](gitlens/gitlens-settings/#worktrees-view-settings) to fit your workflow.
