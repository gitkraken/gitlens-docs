A [customizable](gitlens/gitlens-settings/#worktrees-view-settings) view to create, view, and work with <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/git-worktree" target="_blank">Worktrees</a>. Worktrees allow multiple branches to be checked-out at once on the same repository. This makes it easier to develop on, or test multiple branches, by minimizing the context switching between branches.
