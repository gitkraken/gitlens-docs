## Personalize Your Account

You can personalize your GitKraken account to control how your profile appears to other users within any associated [organization](/gk-dev/gk-dev-organization/). Visit [gitkraken.dev/account](https://gitkraken.dev/?source=help_center&product=gitkraken_dot_dev) after logging in to:

- Update your avatar
- Edit your name, username, and email
- Change your password

To change your avatar, click your profile picture. This will redirect you to [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com), where you can manage the avatar linked to your email address. GitKraken retrieves your avatar from Gravatar based on the shared email between accounts.

> It may take several hours for avatar changes to appear in GitKraken.
