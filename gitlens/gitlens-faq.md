## Is GitLens Free?

Yes, all features are free to use on all repos, **except** for features:  

- marked with `PRO` require a [trial or paid plan](https://www.gitkraken.com/gitlens/pricing) for use on privately hosted repos
- marked with `PREVIEW` require a GitKraken Account, with access level based on your [plan](https://www.gitkraken.com/gitlens/pricing), e.g. Free, Pro, etc

While GitLens offers a remarkable set of free features, a subset of features tailored for professional developers and teams, marked with `PRO`, require a trial or paid plan for use on privately hosted repos &mdash; use on local or publicly hosted repos is free for everyone. Additionally some features marked with a ☁️, rely on GitKraken Dev Services which requires an account and access is based on your plan, e.g. Free, Pro, etc.

Preview `PRO` features instantly for free for 3 days without an account, or start a free Pro trial to get an additional 7 days and gain access to ☁️ features to experience the full power of GitLens.
